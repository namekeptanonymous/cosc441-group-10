# COSC 441's Group 10's Project!

## 👋 Introduction
Hi! This is a Unity project for our COSC 441 research project — a cursor-snapping TV keyboard proof-of-concept! We've just set this repo up so there are going to be some oddities or incomplete files here and there.

## 📚 Concept
Typing on virtual keyboards using TV remotes is often a time-consuming and inefficient process. We aim to address this issue by designing a more intuitive and precise input method for large-screen devices such as TVs—namely a cursor that snaps to the nearest key on the virtual keyboard when slowing down. The cursor moves via a touchpad on a TV remote, such as the one on the 2015 Apple TV remote.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack (planned)
- **Frontend/Backend:** Unity 2D
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Target Device:** Large-screen devices such as TVs
- **Analysis Method:** R and/or SPSS
