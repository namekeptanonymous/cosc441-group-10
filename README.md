# COSC 441's Group 10's Project!

## 👋 Introduction
Hi! This is a Unity project for our COSC 441 research project — a cursor-snapping TV keyboard proof-of-concept! This is for a class project (not for something as fleshed out as a Capstone Project) so there may be oddities to be seen here and there in this repo.

## 📚 Concept
Typing on virtual keyboards using TV remotes is often a time-consuming and inefficient process. We aim to address this issue by designing a more intuitive and precise input method for large-screen devices such as TVs—namely a cursor that snaps to the nearest key on the virtual keyboard when slowing down. The cursor moves via a touchpad on a TV remote, such as the one on the 2015 Apple TV remote.
